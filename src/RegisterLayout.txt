1. VotingFrame.java
This frame should contain:

Labels and text fields to display voting options (e.g., candidate names or proposals).
A set of radio buttons or checkboxes for the user to select their choice.
A "Submit Vote" button to cast the vote.
A "Logout" button to allow the user to log out and return to the login screen.
2. Vote Model
Create a Vote class in the Voting.Models package to represent each vote cast by a user. It should contain:

User ID (to track who cast the vote)
Voter ID (if you want to anonymize)
Choice made (e.g., candidate name or option)
Timestamp of when the vote was cast
3. VotingService.java
A service to handle voting logic such as verifying if a user is eligible to vote, saving the vote to the text file, and ensuring each user can only vote once.

This will be similar to RegisterService but focused on voting functionality.

4. Vote Storage
Use the text file database to store votes temporarily. Each vote entry should contain details like the user ID, the choice, and the timestamp.
Create a utility method to read and write votes to/from the file.
